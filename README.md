A deep learning-based approach to detect diabetic retinopathy in eye images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This project leverages the **APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection dataset** and achieves **96% accuracy** with an optimized Faster CNN architecture.

## ðŸ“œ Project Overview

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, and early detection is crucial for treatment. This project aims to classify the severity of DR using retinal images into 5 categories:

- **No DR**
- **Mild**
- **Moderate**
- **Severe**
- **Proliferative DR**

The model is trained using an efficient CNN architecture, with fine-tuned hyperparameters and image preprocessing techniques for high accuracy and faster inference.
